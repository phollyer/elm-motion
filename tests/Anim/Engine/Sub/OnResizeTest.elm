module Anim.Engine.Sub.OnResizeTest exposing (suite)

{-| Tests for `onResize`, which mutates an in-flight translate
animation to match a new bounding range. Two strategies:

  - `Proportional` preserves normalized progress within the old/new range.
  - `Clamp` keeps the current value but re-clamps it (and the target) into
    the new range.

Animations are stepped via `Sub.update` with `Internal.AnimationFrame` and
queried via `Sub.getTranslateCurrent` / `getTranslateEnd`.
