{-| Internal accumulator used by `Anim.Resize.Builder.Builder` (the public
opaque alias) and consumed by engine `onResize` functions.

A `Builder` is constructed by composing per-property `bounds` functions
exposed from property modules - e.g.

    Translate.bounds "box" bounds

Each call records a bounds directive against a specific anim group, so a single
builder can target many groups at once. Per-group group-wide defaults
may also be supplied via [`Anim.Resize.bounds`](Anim-Resize#bounds);
engines look up the resize policy for each property from the `AnimBuilder`'s
persistent state and fall back to `proportionalPolicy` by default.
