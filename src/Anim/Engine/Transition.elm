# Types

@docs AnimState, AnimGroupName


## Builders

@docs AnimBuilder


### Timeline Builder

This Engine uses the browser's Document timeline, along with the Keyframe, Sub, and WAAPI Engines.

Use the `TimelineBuilder` to configure animations that run on the Document timeline only. If any Engines
are used that don't run on the Document timeline (e.g., Scroll or View), you'll get a type error.

@docs TimelineBuilder


### Engine Builder

The `EngineBuilder` is a builder type restricted to the Transition Engine.

Use the `EngineBuilder` when you want to restrict helpers to the Transition Engine.

-}
animate : AnimState -> (EngineBuilder -> EngineBuilder) -> AnimState
animate =
    Internal.animate


{-| Re-anchor an animation to a new target by snapping to the new end values.

The Transition engine has no JavaScript-side runtime snapshot of the
currently rendered values - it only knows the previous _target_, not where
the element actually is on screen. That makes it impossible to smoothly
continue an in-flight transition when the target changes mid-flight (the
typical resize-handler case).

`retarget` therefore guarantees a deterministic outcome: the element snaps
to the freshly computed end values with `transition: none` and the
animation group is marked complete. It's safe to call repeatedly during a
drag or resize without accumulating partial transitions or visual glitches.

The Sub and WAAPI engines provide a `retarget` with the same builder API
that smoothly continues from the current rendered position - swap in those
engines if you need visual continuity instead of a snap.

-- ============================================================
-- EASING

easing =
    CSS.easing



-- ============================================================
-- SPRING
-- ============================================================


{-| Set a spring as the default for all animations in this builder.

Setting `spring` clears any previously-set global `easing`, and vice
versa — they are mutually exclusive.

Spring-driven motion has _emergent_ duration: the motion ends when
the value has settled at the target. Per-property `duration` and
`speed` are ignored when a spring is in effect; `delay` is honoured.

**Caveat for the Transition engine.** CSS `transition` only supports
a single `cubic-bezier(...)` timing function per property, so this
engine cannot reproduce the full bouncing character of an under-damped
spring. When a spring is set, the duration is overridden to the
spring's settle time and the timing function falls back to a single
overshoot bezier (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`) that conveys a
spring-like "snap" feel. For faithful spring physics, use the
`Keyframe`, `WAAPI`, or `Sub` engine.

    import Anim.Engine.Transition as Transition
    import Anim.Property.Translate as Translate
    import Motion.Spring as Spring

    Transition.animate model.animState <|
        Transition.spring Spring.wobbly
            >> Translate.for "box"
            >> Translate.toX 200

-}
stop : AnimGroupName -> AnimState -> AnimState
stop =

{-| Reset an animation by instantly jumping back to its start state.

    import Anim.Engine.Transition as Transition

    Transition.reset "animGroup" model.animState

-}
reset : AnimGroupName -> AnimState -> AnimState
reset =
    Internal.reset



-- ============================================================
-- DISCRETE PROPERTIES
-- ============================================================


{-| Add a discrete CSS property for entry animations.

The value is applied as an inline style from the first frame and held throughout
the animation. Use this when an element is appearing (e.g., going from
`display: none` to `display: block`).

For entry animations, pair this with `startingStyleNode` so the browser knows
what values to transition from.

    import Anim.Engine.Transition as Transition
    import Anim.Property.Opacity as Opacity

    Transition.animate model.animState <|
        Transition.discreteEntry "display" "block"
            >> Opacity.for "box"
            >> Opacity.to 1
            >> Opacity.build

-}
discreteEntry : String -> String -> EngineBuilder -> EngineBuilder
discreteEntry =
    CSS.discreteEntry


{-| Add a discrete CSS property for exit animations.

Exit animations need to hold their initial state
until the very end of the animation, at which point they flip to the final state.

Therefore you need to set both the `from` and `to` values for the property.

Use when an element is disappearing (e.g., going from
`display: block` to `display: none`).

    import Anim.Engine.Transition as Transition
    import Anim.Property.Opacity as Opacity

    Transition.animate model.animState <|
        Transition.discreteExit "display" "block" "none"
            >> Opacity.for "box"
            >> Opacity.to 0
