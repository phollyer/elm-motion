{-| Analytical damped-harmonic-oscillator solver for spring-based motion.

Solves the standard second-order ODE

    m · ẍ + c · ẋ + k · x = 0

in closed form across all three damping regimes (under-, critically-,
over-damped). No numerical integration: every query is O(1) regardless
of how far along in time it is.

The variable `x` represents _displacement from the target_, so a
configuration animating from value `f` to value `t` is solved with
initial conditions `x(0) = f - t`, `ẋ(0) = initialVelocity`. Position
at time `τ` is then `t + x(τ)`.

Time is exposed in milliseconds at the API boundary (consistent with
the rest of the codebase) and converted to seconds internally for the
physics math.

{-| Spring configuration.

  - `stiffness` — Hooke's-law `k`. Higher = snappier. Typical 100..400.
  - `damping` — viscous-friction `c`. Higher = less wobble. Typical 10..40.
  - `mass` — oscillator `m`. Typical 1.0.
  - `initialVelocity` — `ẋ(0)` in units per second. Zero unless handing
    off from a gesture.

The damping ratio `ζ = c / (2·√(k·m))` determines which regime applies:

  - `ζ < 1` — under-damped, oscillates and decays
  - `ζ = 1` — critically damped, fastest no-overshoot settle
  - `ζ > 1` — over-damped, slow no-overshoot approach

{-| Position at the given time (in milliseconds from motion start).

Returns `from` at `timeMs = 0` and converges to `to` as `timeMs`
increases past the settle time.

-}
valueAt : MotionParams -> Float -> Float
valueAt params timeMs =
    params.to + displacement (precompute params) (timeMs / 1000.0)


{-| Velocity at the given time, in units per second.

Returns `spring.initialVelocity` at `timeMs = 0` and converges to 0 as
`timeMs` increases past the settle time.

-}
velocityAt : MotionParams -> Float -> Float
velocityAt params timeMs =
    velocity (precompute params) (timeMs / 1000.0)


{-| Time at which the motion is considered settled, in milliseconds.

Settled means displacement and velocity have both decayed below a
visually negligible threshold. Hard-capped at 5 minutes as a sanity
bound for degenerate configurations (e.g. zero stiffness, zero damping)
that would otherwise never settle; real spring configurations finish
well within this limit.

-- BAKE
-- ============================================================


{-| Bake the motion to keyframe samples for engines that need a static
representation (Keyframe `@keyframes` stops, WAAPI `easingKeyframes`
arrays, scroll-timeline scrubbing).

Returns:

  - `durationMs` — total wall-clock time the motion takes to settle.
    Engines should use this as the animation's `duration` so that the
    baked samples play out at real-time speed.
  - `samples` — list of `(offset, value)` pairs where `offset` is the
    fraction of `durationMs` (i.e. `0..1`) and `value` is the position
    at that point in time. The first sample is `(0, from)` and the last
    sample is `(1, to)`.

The sample count scales with `durationMs` (~60 samples per second of
motion, floored at 60 and capped at 1000) so long-running springs stay
smooth when engines linearly interpolate between samples.

short easings leaves long springs with samples spaced far enough apart
that linear interpolation between them becomes visible. Aim for ~60
samples per second of motion, with a floor at 60 (so short motions are
unaffected) and a cap at 1000 (so degenerate-long settle times don't
blow up the keyframe array).

bound is sufficient.
