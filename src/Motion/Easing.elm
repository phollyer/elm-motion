module Motion.Easing exposing (Easing(..))

{-| Easing functions for animations and scrolls.

Use them to create smooth and natural movement.

If you don't set an easing function, the defaults are:

  - Animations: `EaseInOut`, which is a good general-purpose easing.
  - Scrolls: `QuintOut`, which gives a nice smooth scroll effect, with a natural "settling into place" feel.

📖 See [Easing Documentation](https://phollyer.github.io/elm-motion/animation/concepts/easing/) in the docs for more info.
