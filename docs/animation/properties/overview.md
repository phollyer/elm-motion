# Properties Overview

This page mainly covers the shared patterns that are used by each Property. For property-specific details, see each individual property page.

## Builder Pattern

Every property uses the same pattern: target an animation group, set values, configure timing, and build.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    animationFunction : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    animationFunction =
        Property.for animGroup              -- Animation group name (required)
            >> Property.from startValue     -- Optional starting value
            >> Property.to endValue         -- Property specific alternatives to `to` are available
            >> Property.delay 100           -- ms
            >> Property.duration 500        -- ms, or `Property.speed 50` (units per second)
            >> Property.easing BounceOut    -- or `Property.spring wobbly`
            >> Property.build               -- Finalize (required)
    ```

📖 See [The Builder Pattern](../workflow/build.md#the-builder-pattern) for more information.

## Animation Groups

These are important. An animation group is a group of properties that animate on an element together.

Properties are added to an animation group by providing the group name as a string when starting an animation pipeline. This is done with the `for` function:

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    myAnimation : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    myAnimation =
        Translate.for "myGroup"
            >> ... -- Continue configuring the animation
    ```

📖 See [Animation Group Names](../workflow/build.md#animation-group-names) for more information.

## Start Values

All animations need a start value.

All properties have either an `init` function, or a variety of `init*` functions that are property specific, or both. These should be used in the Engine's `init` function to set initial values for properties.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    Transition.init [ Opacity.init "animGroup" 0 ]

    Keyframe.init [ Size.initHW "animGroup" 80 100 ]

    WAAPI.init [ Translate.initXYZ "animGroup" 50 100 75 ]
    ```

This performs three functions:

- It sets initial values for first render
- It gives the Engine starting values to use for the first time the `animGroup` is animated
- It ensures the Engine and your view are in sync

!!! tip "`from*`"
    All properties have either a `from` function, or a variety of `from*` functions that are property specific, or both. In general, these won't be needed, but are made available in order to override default Engine behaviour if required.

    If in doubt, start without; only add when needed.


## End Values

All animations need an end value.

All properties have either a `to` function, or a variety of `to*` functions that are property specific, or both.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    myAnimation : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    myAnimation =
        Opacity.for "animGroup"
            >> Opacity.to 1
            >> ... -- Continue configuring the animation

    myAnimation : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    myAnimation =
        Size.for "animGroup"
            >> Size.toHW 150 120
            >> ... -- Continue configuring the animation

    myAnimation : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    myAnimation =
        Translate.for "animGroup"
            >> Translate.toXYZ 120 150 100
            >> ... -- Continue configuring the animation
    ```

## Easing

Make your animations smooth and life-like with easing curves.

All properties have an `easing` function which takes an `Easing` type variant. This will override any default easing set by the Engine.

??? example "View Source"

    ```elm 
    import Motion.Easing as Easing exposing (Easing(..))

    slideInAnimation : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    alideInAnimation =
        Translate.for "sidebarAnim"
            >> Translate.toX 0
            >> Translate.easing BounceOut
            >> ... -- Continue configuring the animation
    ```

📖 See [Easing Type](../concepts/easing.md) for more information.

## Delay

Add a delay before the animation starts.

All properties have a `delay` function which takes an `Int` representing milliseconds. This will override any default delay set by the Engine.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    fadeInAfterDelay : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    fadeInAfterDelay =
        Opacity.for "contentAnim"
            >> Opacity.to 1
            >> Opacity.delay 300
            >> ... -- Continue configuring the animation
    ```

!!! tip "Staggering animations"
    Use different delays on properties within the same group to stagger their start times, creating a sequenced feel without needing separate animations.


## Duration

Set a fixed time for the animation to complete.

All properties have a `duration` function which takes an `Int` representing milliseconds. This will override any default duration set by the Engine.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    slideIn : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    slideIn =
        Translate.for "panelAnim"
            >> Translate.toX 0
            >> Translate.duration 500
            >> ... -- Continue configuring the animation
    ```

📖 See [Duration vs Speed](../concepts/timing.md#duration-vs-speed) for more information.


## Speed

Set a consistent velocity for the animation, where time varies based on the distance between start and end values. Longer distances take longer, shorter distances take less time.

All properties have a `speed` function which takes a `Float`. The unit depends on the property. This will override any default speed set by the Engine.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    moveToTarget : Float -> AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    moveToTarget targetX =
        Translate.for "cursorAnim"
            >> Translate.toX targetX
            >> Translate.speed 500
            >> ... -- Continue configuring the animation
    ```

!!! tip "When to use `speed` over `duration`"
    `speed` is ideal when the distance varies at runtime — for example, drag-and-drop targets or scrolling to dynamic positions. It gives a consistent feel regardless of how far the element needs to travel.

📖 See [Duration vs Speed](../concepts/timing.md#duration-vs-speed) for more information.

## Build

`build` completes the pattern and returns an `AnimBuilder`, allowing you to build another animation or pass the builder to an engine for triggering.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    myAnimation : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    myAnimation =
        Translate.for "myGroup"
            >> Translate.toX 100
            >> Translate.build              -- Returns AnimBuilder mode
            >> Opacity.for "myGroup"        -- Start next property
            >> Opacity.to 1
            >> Opacity.build                -- Returns AnimBuilder mode
            >> Translate.for "myOtherGroup" -- Start another group
            >> Translate.toY 200
            >> Translate.build              -- Returns AnimBuilder mode
    ```
