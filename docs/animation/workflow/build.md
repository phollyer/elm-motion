# Build

## The Builder Pattern

Elm Motion uses a fluent builder pattern for defining animations.
This approach provides a consistent, composable API across all engines
and properties that reads naturally and is easy to reason about — you can
see at a glance what an animation does and how it behaves.

## Basic Structure

Every animation follows this pattern:


??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    animationFunction : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    animationFunction =
        Property.for animGroup              -- Animation group name (required)
            >> Property.from startValue     -- Optional starting value
            >> Property.to endValue         -- Property specific alternatives to `to` are available
            >> Property.delay 100           -- ms
            >> Property.duration 500        -- ms, or `Property.speed 50` (units per second)
            >> Property.easing BounceOut    -- or `Property.spring wobbly`
            >> Property.build               -- Finalize (required)
    ```

    `for` and `build` are required to start and end the builder chain respectively. All other configurations are optional,
    although without an end value the animations won't have anywhere to go!!

## Builder Modes

A typical builder function has the following type signature:

```elm
f : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
```

The builder type signature includes the `mode` type parameter which can be used to tighten the use of a function, and trigger compiler errors if used outside of the specified use.

See [Builder Modes](../concepts/builder-modes.md) for detailed guidance, equivalence examples,
and rules of thumb for choosing the right level of type restriction.

## Animation Group Names

The first argument to `Property.for` is the **animation group name** — a string that groups
animation configurations together. Use it to animate multiple properties at once, or to create
multiple animations for different elements.

### Multiple Properties

Properties with the same group name animate together and are applied to the same element:

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    -- Both properties share "boxAnim" - they animate together on the same element
    enterAnimation : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    enterAnimation =
        Opacity.for "boxAnim"
            >> Opacity.to 1
            >> Opacity.build
            >> Translate.for "boxAnim"
            >> Translate.toY 0
            >> Translate.build
    ```

### Multiple Animations

Use different group names when you want separate animation sets for different elements:

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    -- Different groups for different element animations
    pageAnimations : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    pageAnimations =
        Opacity.for "header"            -- Header fades in
            >> Opacity.to 1
            >> Opacity.build
            >> Translate.for "sidebar"  -- Sidebar slides in
            >> Translate.toX 0
            >> Translate.build
    ```

## Best Practices

!!! tip "Keep animations small and focused"
    Create small, single-purpose animation functions and compose them together.

!!! tip "Use meaningful names"
    Name your animation functions based on what they do: `fadeIn`, `slideLeft`, `bounceOnHover`.

!!! tip "Extract common patterns"
    If you use the same configurations often, create helper functions.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    fadeIn : String -> AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    fadeIn animGroup =
        Opacity.for animGroup
            >> Opacity.to 1
            >> Opacity.build

    rotateClockwise : String -> AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    rotateClockwise animGroupName =
        Rotate.for animGroup
            >> Rotate.toZ 90
            >> Rotate.build

    rotateAntiClockwise : String -> AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    rotateAntiClockwise animGroupName =
        Rotate.for animGroup
            >> Rotate.toZ 0
            >> Rotate.build

    slideDown : String -> AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    slideDown animGroup =
        Translate.for animGroup
            >> Translate.toY 50
            >> Translate.build


    slideUp : String -> AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    slideUp animGroup =
        Translate.for animGroup
            >> Translate.toY 0
            >> Translate.build

    -- Common timing helper
    withStandardTiming : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    withStandardTiming =
        Engine.duration 300
            >> Engine.easing QuintOut

    -- Compose small helpers into a larger animation
    myAnimation : String -> AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    myAnimation animGroup =
        withStandardTiming
            >> fadeIn animGroup
            >> slideUp animGroup
            >> rotateClockwise animGroup

    myOtherAnimation : String -> AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    myOtherAnimation animGroup =
        withStandardTiming
            >> fadeIn animGroup
            >> slideDown animGroup
            >> rotateAntiClockwise animGroup
    ```

## Next Steps

Now that you've defined your animations, the next step is initializing your animation state.
