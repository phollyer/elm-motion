# Sub Engine

This page is a practical guide to using the Sub engine from setup through advanced usage.
Read [Engines Overview](overview.md) when you want side-by-side comparisons and tradeoffs.

The Sub Engine uses Elm subscriptions to update animation state on every frame. This provides full programmatic control over animations, including mid-flight queries and mid-flight redirections.

## Example

Animation control - use the buttons to control the bouncing ball animation.

## Quick Walkthrough

Get up and running in minutes.

### 1. Build

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    import Anim.Engine.Sub as Sub
    import Anim.Property.Translate as Translate


    drop : Sub.AnimBuilder mode -> Sub.AnimBuilder mode
    drop =
        Translate.for "ball"
            >> Translate.toY 240
            >> Translate.duration 450
            >> Translate.build
    ```

### 2. Initialize

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    type alias Model =
        { animState : Sub.AnimState }


    init : ( Model, Cmd Msg )
    init =
        ( { animState = Sub.init [ Translate.initY "ball" 0 ] }
        , Cmd.none
        )
    ```

### 3. Render

Render animation attributes on the element being animated.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    view : Model -> Html Msg
    view model =
        div []
            [ button [ onClick TriggerDrop ] [ text "Drop" ]
            , div (Sub.attributes "ball" model.animState) [ text "Ball" ]
            ]
    ```

### 4. Trigger with `animate`

Call `animate` to apply the animation config to the current `AnimState`.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    TriggerDrop ->
        ( { model | animState = Sub.animate model.animState drop }
        , Cmd.none
        )
    ```

### 5. React

Subscribe to frame messages, then process them with `update`. See [Subscriptions](#subscriptions) and [Update](#update) for full details.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    type Msg
        = TriggerDrop
        | GotAnimMsg Sub.AnimMsg


    subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
    subscriptions model =
        Sub.subscriptions GotAnimMsg model.animState


    update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
    update msg model =
        case msg of
            GotAnimMsg animMsg ->
                let
                    ( animState, events ) =
                        Sub.update animMsg model.animState
                in
                List.foldl handleAnimEvent ( { model | animState = animState }, Cmd.none ) events

            _ ->
                ( model, Cmd.none )
    ```
---

## In Detail

### Initialize

Pass a list of property initializers to `init`. Each registers an animation group name and sets the element's starting inline style from the first render.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    init : ( Model, Cmd Msg )
    init =
        ( { animState = Sub.init [ Opacity.init "ball" 0 ] }
        , Cmd.none
        )
    ```

### Trigger

Call `animate` to apply an animation to the current `AnimState`. Triggering a new animation while one is already running smoothly transitions from the current mid-flight position to the new end values.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    TriggerDrop ->
        ( { model | animState = Sub.animate model.animState dropBall }
        , Cmd.none
        )
    ```

📖 See [Interrupting Animations](../concepts/interrupting-animations.md/) for more info.

### Mid-Flight Interruptions

Sub keeps frame-by-frame runtime state, so interrupting with a new `animate` (or `retarget`) continues smoothly from the current in-flight position.

### OnLoad Animations

For on-load animations, trigger `animate` when the page initializes, the animation runs immediately.

### Events

`update` returns a `List AnimEvent` per call — multiple events can occur in a single frame. Use `List.foldl` to process them.

Each event carries the animation group name, and some carry an additional value:

- `Cancelled` and `Paused` include the progress at the moment of cancellation/pause (`Float`, 0.0–1.0)
- `Iteration` includes the iteration count (`Int`)
- `Progress` fires every frame with the current progress (`Float`, 0.0–1.0)

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    handleAnimEvent : AnimEvent -> ( Model, Cmd Msg ) -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
    handleAnimEvent event ( model, cmd ) =
        case event of
            Started "ball" ->
                ( model, cmd )

            Ended "ball" ->
                ( model, cmd )

            Cancelled "ball" _ ->
                ( model, cmd )

            Progress "ball" progress ->
                ( { model | ballProgress = progress }, cmd )

            _ ->
                ( model, cmd )
    ```

### Update

Use `update` to process incoming animation messages. It returns the updated `AnimState` and a list of any events that occurred during that frame.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    GotAnimMsg animMsg ->
        let
            ( animState, events ) =
                Sub.update animMsg model.animState
        in
        List.foldl handleAnimEvent ( { model | animState = animState }, Cmd.none ) events
    ```

### Subscriptions

The Sub engine requires a subscription to receive animation frame updates. The subscription is dormant when no animations are active.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
    subscriptions model =
        Sub.subscriptions GotAnimMsg model.animState
    ```

### View

Apply `attributes` to the animated element to apply the current inline styles on each frame.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    div (Sub.attributes "ball" model.animState) [ text "Ball" ]
    ```


### Responsive Strategy

Use relative CSS units whenever the motion can be defined in layout-relative terms.

For measured pixel targets:

- Sub supports proportional remap for resize updates.
- On resize, update bounds with `onResize` and `Anim.Resize.bounds`.
- Running animations remap to the equivalent relative position inside the updated bounds.
- Idle animations also re-position proportionally inside the updated bounds.

📖 See [Responsive Animations](../concepts/responsive-animations.md) for more info.

### Playback

Set `iterations`, `loopForever`, and `alternate` in the animation builder.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    spinForever =
        Rotate.for "icon"
            >> Rotate.toZ 360
            >> Rotate.duration 1000
            >> Sub.loopForever
            >> Sub.alternate
            >> Rotate.build
    ```

### Timing

Set `duration`, `speed`, and `delay` in the animation builder.

- `duration` — animation length in milliseconds.
- `speed` — alternative to `duration`; set a rate in property units per second.
- `delay` — wait before the animation begins, in milliseconds.

### Easing

Sub animations use the full Easing library with exact mathematical curves — including bounce and elastic.

📖 See [Easing](../concepts/easing.md) for all available easing functions.

### Controls

All Sub control functions return `AnimState` directly — no `Cmd` needed, unlike Keyframe.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    Pause ->
        ( { model | animState = Sub.pause "ball" model.animState }, Cmd.none )

    Resume ->
        ( { model | animState = Sub.resume "ball" model.animState }, Cmd.none )

    Restart ->
        ( { model | animState = Sub.restart "ball" model.animState }, Cmd.none )

    Stop ->
        ( { model | animState = Sub.stop "ball" model.animState }, Cmd.none )

    Reset ->
        ( { model | animState = Sub.reset "ball" model.animState }, Cmd.none )
    ```

### Discrete Properties

The Sub engine manages discrete properties as inline styles. `discreteEntry` values are applied from the first animation frame, and `discreteExit` values flip on the last frame. No additional view setup is needed.

📖 See [Discrete Properties](../concepts/discrete-properties.md) for the full API, live examples, and source code.

### Transform Order

Use `transformOrder` to set the order in which transform properties are applied for the next animation.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    import Anim.Extra.TransformOrder exposing (TransformProperty(..))

    animateBox =
        Sub.transformOrder [ Scale, Rotate, Translate ]
            >> Translate.for "box"
            >> ...
    ```

📖 See [Transform Order](../concepts/transform-order.md) for full details.

### Freeze Axes

Freeze one or more transform axes so they stop updating during subsequent frames, while the rest of the animation continues.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    -- Freeze translate and rotate axes
    Sub.freeze "ball" [ Translate, Rotate ] model.animState

    -- Unfreeze all axes
    Sub.unfreeze "ball" [ Translate, Rotate, Scale, Skew ] model.animState
    ```

### State Queries

Query animation state at any time without waiting for events.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    Sub.anyRunning model.animState           -- Maybe Bool
    Sub.isRunning "ball" model.animState     -- Maybe Bool
    Sub.allComplete model.animState          -- Maybe Bool
    Sub.isComplete "ball" model.animState    -- Maybe Bool
    Sub.isCancelled "ball" model.animState   -- Maybe Bool
    Sub.getProgress "ball" model.animState   -- Maybe Float (0.0–1.0)
    ```

`Nothing` is returned when no animation exists for the given group.

### Property Queries

Because the Sub engine updates on every frame, current values are always accessible.

??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    Sub.getOpacityStart "ball" model.animState    -- Maybe Float
    Sub.getOpacityEnd "ball" model.animState      -- Maybe Float
    Sub.getOpacityCurrent "ball" model.animState  -- Maybe Float
    Sub.getTranslateCurrent "ball" model.animState -- Maybe { x, y, z }
    ```

`Nothing` is returned when no animation exists for the given group.

### When to Choose This Engine

Choose Sub when you want maximum Elm-side control with per-frame updates and current-value access.

- Best for: gameplay-style interactions, simulation-like motion, and logic that reacts continuously to animation progress.
- Avoid when: you prefer browser-native animation execution with less Elm runtime work.
- Prefer: [WAAPI](waapi.md) for browser-native playback with rich controls.
