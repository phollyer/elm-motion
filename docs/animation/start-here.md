## Timelines

Animations need a timeline to animate on, and modern Browsers have three: Document, Scroll and Viewport.

The Document timeline ties animations to **time** and is the one most folks use and maybe do so without knowing about it. If you've ever done CSS transition, keyframe or `subscriptions` (`requestAnimationFrame`) animations, you've used the Document timeline. Perhaps unsurprisingly then, the Transition, Keyframe, Sub and WAAPI Engines all animate on the Document timeline.

Introduced around July 2023 are the more recent additions of the Scroll and Viewport timelines. These tie animations to scroll position and viewport position respectively, not time, allowing animations to run in relation to scroll position as the user scrolls the document or container. The ScrollTimeline and ViewTimeline Engines target these new timelines.

Due to the Scroll and Viewport timelines being fairly recent additions, not all browsers may support them. At the time of writing, Firefox doesn't. This is not a problem though, because the JS companion automatically falls back to  [scroll-timeline-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scroll-timeline-polyfill) so your users always get the intended experience regardless of browser support.

## Coding Style

The library codebase, and all the examples use function composition extensively.

??? note "New to function composition (`>>`)?"

    If you are more used to Elm's pipeline operator (`|>`), here's how they compare:

    ```elm
    -- Using pipelines (|>)
    fadeIn : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    fadeIn animBuilder =
        animBuilder
            |> Opacity.for groupName
            |> Opacity.to 1
            |> Opacity.duration 5000
            |> Opacity.build

    -- Using function composition (>>)
    fadeIn : AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode
    fadeIn =
        Opacity.for groupName
            >> Opacity.to 1
            >> Opacity.duration 5000
            >> Opacity.build
    ```

    Both produce identical results. Because these builders are all functions of type `AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode`, they compose naturally with `>>`. This codebase prefers the composition style because it keeps builder definitions concise and usually reads more cleanly than threading an explicit `animBuilder` through a pipeline.

    The composition style works because each builder step is itself a *partially-applied* function of type `AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode` - every argument except the builder has been supplied. `>>` then chains those partially-applied functions end-to-end into one larger function with the same `AnimBuilder mode -> AnimBuilder mode` shape.

## Examples

Throughout the documentation you will find examples demonstrating features or concepts. The vast majority are for animations on the Document timeline, therefore all these examples will show the exact same animation for each of the Document timeline Engines.

!!! info "Responsive by default"

    All examples in this documentation are responsive - they adapt smoothly when the viewport is resized. If an engine tab is missing from a given example, it is because that engine either cannot express the animation at all, or cannot do so responsively. The remaining engine tabs show the same animation built with engines that can.

Here's a few examples to get started with.
