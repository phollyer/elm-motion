# Philosophy

## One Animation → Multiple Engines

There are many different approaches to creating animations on the web, and many good Elm packages that target various approaches. If all approaches were equal, you could probably pick an Elm package and stick with it.

But they're not all equal.

There are CSS transitions, CSS keyframes, `requestAnimationFrame` animations, the JavaScript Web Animations API... each with different strengths, different performance characteristics, and different use cases.

**Lots of different ways of creating the same thing - an animation.**

### The Problem

At the time of writing, the only available Elm packages for animations are either `subscription` driven, or they generate CSS Keyframe animations - CSS Transitions and the Web Animations API are not supported at all - and as each different Elm package comes with its own learning curve and complexities, as does each different animation approach - and because each Elm package only targets one approach:

    changingApproaches =
        new ElmPackage
            >> new API
            >> new MentalModel

Imagine you've learned and are using an Elm package for CSS Keyframe animations. It's working well. Then further down the line, your team decides to start using a `subscription` based animation package for better playback control.

Now you have another animation approach to learn about. Another Elm package to learn. A different API. A different way of thinking about animations.

**Two different mental models for essentially the same thing - an animation.**

### The Solution

Elm Motion provides a singular, composable builder API to build animation configurations, and multiple engines that consume those configurations and output animations to their own specialty target:

- **Transition Engine** → CSS transitions
- **Keyframe Engine** → CSS keyframes
- **Sub Engine** → Subscription driven (`requestAnimationFrame`)
- **WAAPI Engine** → JavaScript Web Animations API
- **ScrollTimeline Engine** → Scroll position driven playback
- **ViewTimeline Engine** → Viewport position driven playback

Define your animations once.


??? example "View Source Code"

    ```elm
    -- Define once
    fadeIn : AnimBuilder eng -> AnimBuilder eng
    fadeIn =
        Opacity.begin
            >> Opacity.from 0
            >> Opacity.to 1
            >> Opacity.end
    ```

Then use with any engine.

??? example "View Source Code"

    === "Transition"

        ```elm
        Transition.animate model.animState <|
            Transition.for "entranceAnim"
                >> fadeIn
        ```

    === "Keyframe"

        ```elm
        Keyframe.animate model.animState <|
            Keyframe.for "entranceanim"
                >> fadeIn
        ```

    === "Sub"

        ```elm
        Sub.animate model.animState <|
            Sub.for "entranceAnim"
                >> fadeIn
        ```

    === "WAAPI"

        ```elm
        WAAPI.animate model.animState <|
            WAAPI.for "entranceAnim" 
                >> fadeIn
        ```

    === "ScrollTimeline"

        ```elm
        ScrollTimeline.animate motionCmd Document <|
            ScrollTimeline.for "entranceAnim"
                >> fadeIn
        ```

    === "ViewTimeline"

        ```elm
        ViewTimeline.animate motionCmd <|
            ViewTimeline.for "entranceAnim"
                >> fadeIn
        ```

Elm Motion abstracts away the differences in each approach so you can focus on your task at hand rather than a new API - the same animation configurations work with every Engine.

When requirements change — and they always do — you can switch engines without rewriting your animations.

**One mental model - multiple Engines.**

## Why This Matters

Teams evolve. Projects grow. Performance requirements change.

What starts as simple hover effects might need to become complex choreographed sequences. What works on desktop might need optimization for mobile. What was fine with CSS might need the precision of the Web Animations API.

With Elm Motion, you're not locked in. Your animation logic stays stable while you choose the right engine for your needs.

**Learn once. Use everywhere. Adapt when needed.**

## And One More Thing

If animation is about smoothly interpolating values over time, why stop at CSS properties?

Scroll position is just another value. The Scroll Engines apply the same philosophy — smooth, configurable, eased movement — to viewport and container scrolling.

**Same mental model. Different target.**
