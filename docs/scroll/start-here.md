## Choosing a Scroll Engine

Elm Motion provides three scroll engines with one shared builder API.

- `Cmd` - fire-and-forget scrolls with the smallest setup
- `Task` - composable scrolls with typed success/failure results
- `Sub` - state-tracked scrolls with events, controls, and live queries

All three use the same `Scroll.Builder` pipeline, so you can switch engines without rewriting scroll definitions.

## Coding Style

The library codebase, and all the examples, use function composition extensively.

??? note "New to function composition (`>>`)?"

    If you are more used to Elm's pipeline operator (`|>`), here's how they compare:

    ```elm
    -- Using pipelines (|>)
    scrollToElement : String -> ScrollBuilder -> ScrollBuilder
    scrollToElement targetId scrollBuilder =
        scrollBuilder
            |> Scroll.forContainer "scroll-container"
            |> Scroll.toElement targetId
            |> Scroll.speed 250
            |> Scroll.easing BounceOut
            |> Scroll.build

    -- Using function composition (>>)
    scrollToElement : String -> ScrollBuilder -> ScrollBuilder
    scrollToElement targetId =
        Scroll.forContainer "scroll-container"
            >> Scroll.toElement targetId
            >> Scroll.speed 250
            >> Scroll.easing BounceOut
            >> Scroll.build
    ```

    Both produce identical results. Because these builders are all functions of type `ScrollBuilder -> ScrollBuilder`, they compose naturally with `>>`. This codebase prefers the composition style because it keeps builder definitions concise and usually reads more cleanly than threading an explicit `scrollBuilder` through a pipeline.

    The composition style works because each builder step is itself a *partially-applied* function of type `ScrollBuilder -> ScrollBuilder` - every argument except the builder has been supplied. `>>` then chains those partially-applied functions end-to-end into one larger function with the same `ScrollBuilder -> ScrollBuilder` shape.
